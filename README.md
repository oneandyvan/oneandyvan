# Andy Van

## About Me
I'm an avid Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from UCF. Although I specialize in Front-End Development, I love to learn about the other parts of the stack, as well as familiarizing myself with new technologies. I find it fun to be able to realize a project from start to finish, knowing that the finish line can be the start of another lap. 

***Contributing to the comforting moments in life!***
